# Shra'Mo'Vitos
Chiss Imperial Loyalist Agent

Brought up to believe imperial security meant chiss security, he joined imperial inteligence.
Although willing to do what's needed for the mission, he doesn't kill for pleasure like some of his colleagues.

Over time working for the empire, he has grown more emotionally closed off; he has lost patience for conversational pleasantries.
