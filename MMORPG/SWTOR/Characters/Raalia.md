# Raalia
Former Twi'lek sex slave

Enslaved since birth and sold into the sex trade at 14, she'd long since turned inwards and tried to block out the outside world.
Drawing power from her hate and turmoil, her strength with the the dark side of the force grew.
For the last few years she'd been plotting her escape, meanwhile seething on her growing affinity with the dark side.
To her great surprise and relief, she was selected to become an acolyte at the Sith Academy on Korriban.
