# Offline
The use of the word "Offline" at work bothers me. To me, "Offline" means "not on/using the internet" but people use it to mean "outside this meeting", usually using an online messaging app or an email. Using a word that has the opposite meaning and hoping everyone understands eventually leading to everyone using the wrong word until, eventually, it will become accepted despite making no logical sense".
