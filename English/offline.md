# Offline
The use of the word "Offline" at work bothers me. To me, "Offline" means "not on/using the internet" but people use it to mean "outside this meeting but using a messaging app or an email both of which use the internet in some way but I'm lazy so I'm going to use a word that has the opposite meaning and hope you understand me because if we all use the wrong word eventually it will become accepted despite making no logical sense".
