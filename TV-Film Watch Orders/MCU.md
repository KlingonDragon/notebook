¹ Note: I have skipped some promotional internet content (such as tie-in youtube videos) and some less connected TV series.

² Note: I have simplified the overlaps between TV series that don't actually interact with the films or one another. I have not watched some of these for quite some time so I may have oversimplified it too much.
