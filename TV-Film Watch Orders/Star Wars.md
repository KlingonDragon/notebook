¹ Note: While I describe this as a full watch order, it is *my* full watch order. I don't rewatch everything

² Note: As it is a series of animated anthology shorts, these don't actually fit anywhere but I've tried to put them where I could.

## Skywalker Saga³
Medium length; good for a longer marathon over a weekend

0) Episode II: Attack of the Clones
0) Episode III: Revenge of the Sith
0) Rogue One: A Star Wars Story
0) Episode IV: A New Hope
0) Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back
0) Episode VI: Return of the Jedi
0) Episode VII: The Force Awakens
0) Episode VIII: The Last Jedi

³ Note: While I call this the skywalker saga, it contains other films/tv where I feel they add to the story
